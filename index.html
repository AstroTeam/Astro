				<p>
					A classified military space station - the Astroverious - communication signals have gone dark. 
					You have been sent on a solo mission is to retrieve information, including the ship’s black box as well as other info, 
					about why communication went dark and what was happening inside the Astroverious. 
					Upon investing you find that there are weird alien-like creatures all over the ship. 
					These aliens manifest themselves as their own entities but also have spores which can control 
					both people and robots. This allows there to be multiple enemy types: Aliens, infected human crew, 
					infected robot crew, infected ship systems, malfunctioning robots, and more.
