Basic premise:  A classified military space station has gone dark and the mission is to retrieve information, including the ship’s black box as well as other info, about why and what they were doing.

Upon investing you find that there are weird aliens all over the ship.  These aliens manifest themselves as their own entities but also have spores which can control both people and robots.  This allows there to be multiple enemy types: Aliens, infected human crew, crazy human crew, mutated human crew, infected robot crew and infected ship systems, malfunctioning robots, other (such as space rats/infected space rats/mutated space rats.) 

*sidenote: could implement a system where different enemies attack each other, human vs infected human*
*sidenote: could implement friendly/passive human crew/robot crew who help the player*

The player upon startup can choose between a certain race+class combo, each class has 3 “specialty” tech trees that have powerups, skills, etc.  So you pick 1 race, 1 class, and 1 specialty

Races: human, cyborg, drone/droid/robot, possible humanoid alien, etc.
- Races provide basic stat differences like with strength, health, etc.

Classes:
Space marine-> infantry (health basic skills), medic(healing, possible late game healing of infected), quartermaster(good with guns and gun attachments)

Explorer -> survivalist (map skills, scavenging), pirate (offensive attack skills), merchant(hard class, little skills, difficult class to play)

Mercenary -> assassin (high damage low health), brute (high health low damage), retired military(carries over limited marine skills)

Robotic -> combat drone (offensive skills), exploration drone (like survivalist, increased vision, etc.), repair drone (mechanic, repair things)

*sidenote: maybe robots would have high starting armor+health but never be allowed to upgrade like humans so have early game advantage but it degrades as enemies get harder.*
