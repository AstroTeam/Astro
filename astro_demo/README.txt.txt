This is a simple demo of the game engine that I have already written, following the libtcod tutorial on codeumbra.

I have made a few small changes to the functionality of the game, and as such my code is not exactly as it appears in the tutorial.

I do not want to edit too much before we actually start our scrum sprints, else there would probably already be a casting system implemented. 

I have the plans in mind to add a much more generic, and thus much easier to expand, item system.
