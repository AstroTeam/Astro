ASTRO TERMINAL LOGS 
GENERIC –
>>100:238:32<< The ship’s systems went down again.  3 minutes this time.  This is getting ridiculous.
>>100:845:28<< I was walking over to deck 7 and I almost slipped on this weird grass.  I told maintenance about it and they said that they would clean it, but I went back today and it was even bigger.
>>100:738:82<< The grating in the room next to mine keeps getting worse.  Does maintenance do anything around here?
>>100:921:81<< I was walking back to my bunk yesterday and a piece of this moss stuff fell into my eyes, I went to an eyewash station immediately and had the doc look at me.  He said I was fine, but it still burns.
>>100:392:12<< TO:ALL// FROM:HR // There has been a recent rise in unrest and a 75% rise in complaints, 200% rise larceny reports and a 2500% rise in maintenance requests.  Please do what you can to help, the staff is overworked as it is.
>>100:832:05<< I can’t imagine why they need us to all get physicals again, we did like, a week ago.
>>100:333:33<< Of all the times to get 5 3’s on my diary number it is today.  I would celebrate this cool bit of numerology, but my jaw was broken by a mess hall tray today.
>>100:430:89<< The pipes here must be getting faulty or something, I see maintenance here every other day and they never seem to get everything right since they are back tomorrow.

OFFICE –
>>101:739:72<< The printer wouldn’t work.  I took out the toner cartridge and there was a green fungus thing on it, I cleaned it off completely but the printer still wouldn’t work.
>>101:834:82<< TO: JOHNSON// FROM: HENDRIKS// I don’t pay you to sit in your desk, yesterday you barely moved a muscle all day, you didn’t even get up for lunch.  People are starting to talk.  Pull it together.
>>101:820:02<< //MAINTENANCE REQUEST// Computer dysfunctional, glitching.  Needs some sort of repair, no obvious fix.

BARRACKS—
>>102:982:71<< I opened Jim’s locker today, the damn thing smells awful.  It was this weird moss in the bottom of it.
>>102:823:99<< SOMEONE MOVED MY BED! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! I AM GOING TO MURDER THEM!
>>102:483:81<< Henderson found some moss behind his endtable, he cleaned it off but that shit came back.

GENERATOR—
>>103:829:32<< Someone is passing over their pay-grade because something is turning off the engineering lights, and no one is supposed to be toughing those controls.
>>103:728:92<< If anyone touches my pallets I am going to flip out.  THEY ARE MINE!
>>103:932:06<< I had to rig up one of the spare generators today to power the floor, it barely works.

SERVER—
>>104:230:33<< More page faults today, more servers gone down, I feel like someone is messing with me.
>>104:999:01<< One of the CAT-5’s started to have over 65% fault rate, what is even going on?
>>104:192:82<< I can’t believe George yesterday, he tried to unplug 30 different wires, I had to have the marines escort him out!  I guess he finally had enough.  They make us work way too long.

KITCHEN—
>>105:928:01<< As if making food isn’t hard enough on a station these people seem angrier and angrier every day. 
>>105:822:21<< Someone waiting for food in line today straight up punched the guy in front of him, for NO REASON.  I’ve never seen anything like it.
>>105:023:48<< Roger put some of this weird shit in the soup today, it smelled so bad but everyone ate it and we laughed for hours.

MESSHALL—
>>106:293:82<< More trash left out, what are they animals!  This is against protocol.
>>106:732:80<< Today a man smashed his tray over another guy and a whole brawl started!  It took 12 marines to break it up.
>>106:821:92<< If one more person throws their drink on me I am going to the armory and I’m going to shoot all of these idiots.

ARMORY—
>>107:928:92<< If one more person comes in here and asks for an unauthorized gun I am going to shoot them.
>>107:823:02<< //LARCENY REPORT//  3 MLR batteries, 2 MLR’s and 7 combat knifes have gone missing in the past 48 hours.
>>107:821:76<< I have begun to lock up the weapons in the vaults to protect them from this thieving crew.

OBSERVATORY—
>>108:293:43<< The stars are so beautiful.  If only they weren’t painted in red.
>>108:493:26<< The more I look out into space the more I want to jump into it…it seems so peaceful…sublime.
>>108:743:77<< The glass here is so thick, we can look out, but never be connected with space, we are so close, yet, so far…if only I could be closer.

HYDROPONICS—
>>109:829:21<< One of the oranges had a growth on it.  I incinerated it immediately, but then today two more did.
>>109:340:99<< SOMETHING IS WRONG!  SOMETHING IS WRONG! Someone took my fruit!  THAT IS NOT PROTOCOL!
>>109:832:92<< They took it.  I am going to KILL THE NEXT PERSON TO TOUCH MY FRUIT.
